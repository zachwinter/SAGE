## Part 1: The Essential File Manifest

These files represent the failing tests, the code they are testing, the environment configuration, and the server being spawned.

src/mcp/**tests**/e2e/mcp.e2e.test.ts: The primary E2E test that is failing with a timeout. It shows how the server process is configured and started for the test.

src/**tests**/fixtures/mcp-server/server.js: The actual Node.js script being executed by the E2E test. Crucial Note: This script runs successfully when executed manually from the project root (node src/**tests**/fixtures/mcp-server/server.js).

src/mcp/client/MCPClientManager.ts: The application code that contains the connectServer logic, which is directly responsible for spawning the server process via the SDK's StdioClientTransport.

src/mcp/**tests**/process.test.ts: The file containing the second set of failures. It tests the process management functions directly and is currently failing with a timeout due to a complex mocking issue.

src/mcp/process/manager.ts: The application code being tested by process.test.ts. Contains the startServerProcess and restartServerProcess functions.
vitest.config.ts: The configuration file for the Vitest test runner. This is essential for understanding the test environment itself.

## Part 2: Dense Technical Briefing

### High-Level Summary

The test suite is plagued by two independent, persistent failures:

A Module Resolution Failure: Multiple integration and E2E tests (mcp.e2e.test.ts, sdk-diagnostics.test.ts, etc.) fail because they spawn a Node.js server process in a temporary directory. This spawned process then immediately crashes with an ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND because it cannot locate the @modelcontextprotocol/sdk package, as there is no node_modules folder in the temporary directory. This crash leads to timeouts and empty results in the tests.

An Asynchronous Mocking Failure: A specific unit test for the restartServerProcess function in src/mcp/**tests**/process.test.ts is timing out. This is due to an incorrectly orchestrated mock that does not satisfy the asynchronous "ready" signal awaited by the function under test, causing the test's promise to hang indefinitely.

### Problem A: The Module Resolution Failure

#### Symptoms

mcp.e2e.test.ts fails with Error: Timed out waiting for MCP server connect.

sdk-diagnostics.test.ts fails with AssertionError: expected 0 to be greater than 0 because it connects to a crashed server and gets no tools back.

The raw test logs clearly show the underlying cause: Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk'.

#### Key Evidence

The server script src/**tests**/fixtures/mcp-server/server.js is confirmed to be valid and runs without error when executed directly via node from the project's root directory.

The failure only occurs when the script is spawned as a child process from within a Vitest test, which often uses temporary directories for isolation.

#### Solutions Attempted (and Why They Failed)

Setting NODE_PATH in MCPClientManager.ts: This was too specific and only affected tests using that manager, not all tests that spawn processes.

Setting NODE_PATH in vitest.config.ts (env block): This should have worked, but the error persists. This is the most confusing part of the problem and suggests a deep issue with how Vitest's forks pool and Node's modern ES Module loader interact. ES Modules famously do not respect NODE_PATH in the same way CommonJS does.

Setting NODE_PATH in package.json script: This also failed, reinforcing the conclusion that NODE_PATH is being ignored by the ESM loader in the child process.

### Problem B: The Asynchronous Mocking Failure

#### Symptom

The test case Process Management > restartServerProcess > should stop and start a server in src/mcp/**tests**/process.test.ts fails with Error: Test timed out in 10000ms.

#### Key Evidence

The function being tested, startServerProcess, returns a Promise that only resolves after it receives a specific string ("MCP server ready") from the child process's stderr stream.

The test correctly mocks child_process.spawn to return a fake child process object with a mock stderr stream.

However, the test calls await restartServerProcess(...) but never simulates the "ready" signal by writing to the mock stderr stream.

As a result, the promise within the real startServerProcess (which is called by restartServerProcess) never resolves, and the test hangs until Vitest's timeout is reached.
