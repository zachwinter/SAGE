# SAGE

> **"A Codebase is a Living Society."**

SAGE transforms your codebase into a living ecosystem of specialized AI agents that understand, protect, and evolve your code alongside you.

## 🚧 Project Status

SAGE is currently **under active development**. The vision is real, the architecture is sound, but we're still building the society.

**What's Working:**
- Core philosophy and architectural patterns
- Graph-based code analysis foundation
- Agent archetype designs

**Coming Soon:**
- Production-ready CLI installation
- Full agent implementation
- Live codebase interaction

Want to contribute or stay updated? Check out our [Contributing Guide](./DOCS/README.md#-contributing) or explore the codebase to understand the vision.

## 🎭 What Makes SAGE Special

- **🧙 Living Agents:** Six specialized AI archetypes (Sage, Guardian, Librarian, Warden, Delegator, Archivist) each with distinct roles
- **📊 Code Graph:** Your entire codebase mapped as queryable relationships, not just text
- **📚 Perfect Memory:** Every interaction and change is remembered and can inform future decisions
- **🛡️ Built-in Protection:** Agents actively guard against inconsistencies and breaking changes
- **🎯 Contract-First:** Every component has explicit behavioral guarantees
