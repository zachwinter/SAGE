# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how utils relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section explains why utils has no dependencies (foundational package)
- [ ] Dependents section shows how all SAGE packages depend on utils
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to enabling other packages is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how all SAGE packages depend on utils for core functionality
- Explain the dependency tree and how everything builds on this foundation
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like consistency and shared types
- Clarify the role of utils as the base layer for all other packages
