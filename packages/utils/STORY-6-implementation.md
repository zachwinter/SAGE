# Story 6: Document Implementation Status and Usage Patterns

## Description

As a contributor to the SAGE project or advanced user, I want to understand the current implementation status and usage patterns so that I can effectively use or contribute to the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Development Status clearly indicates current progress with completed stories
- [ ] Usage patterns and best practices are documented
- [ ] Implementation details and design decisions are explained
- [ ] Connection to deterministic testing is covered

## Implementation Notes

- Document the current implementation status (what's completed)
- Explain usage patterns and best practices for the utilities
- Cover design decisions that make these utilities foundational
- Reference the connection to deterministic testing and time/random abstractions
