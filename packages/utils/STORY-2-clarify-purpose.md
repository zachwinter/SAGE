# Story 2: Clarify Package Purpose and Value

## Description

As a developer evaluating SAGE tools, I want to understand what utils package is and why it exists so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overview section clearly explains what utils package does (foundational utilities, types, error handling)
- [ ] Value proposition is evident (zero runtime deps, foundational role, shared types)
- [ ] Connection to SAGE's "Foundation" concept is clear
- [ ] Relationship to enabling other packages is explained

## Implementation Notes

- Emphasize the foundational role and zero runtime dependencies
- Connect to how this enables consistency across all other SAGE packages
- Explain how shared types and utilities reduce duplication
