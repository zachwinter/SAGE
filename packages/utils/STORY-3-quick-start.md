# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to use utils package, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows most commonly used utilities (error handling, types)
- [ ] Demonstrates practical usage patterns
- [ ] Code is relevant to package developers
- [ ] Showcases the foundational nature

## Implementation Notes

- Create an example showing common utilities like error handling and type usage
- Include practical usage patterns that package developers would actually use
- Focus on the most essential utilities rather than comprehensive listing
- Make it clear how these utilities are foundational to other packages
