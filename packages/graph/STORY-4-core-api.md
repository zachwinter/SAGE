# Story 4: Document Core API

## Description

As a developer integrating Graph into my project, I want clear documentation of the main classes and methods so that I can effectively use the package in my code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core API section documents main functions (`ingestProject`, `queryGraph`)
- [ ] Key interfaces (`IngestOptions`, `QueryOptions`) are explained
- [ ] Schema definitions and node types are documented
- [ ] Example queries are provided for common use cases

## Implementation Notes

- Extract API information from the existing README
- Show real method signatures and usage patterns
- Document the graph schema with node types and relationships
