# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how Graph relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/utils`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how `@sage/agents` and `@sage/aql` use Graph
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to agents' reasoning and code understanding is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how agents use Graph for reasoning and Gnosis
- Explain how AQL uses graph for query execution
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like ground truth and verifiable knowledge
