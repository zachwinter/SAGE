# Story 1: Standardize README Structure

## Description

As a developer new to the SAGE ecosystem, I want the `@sage/graph` README to follow the standardized template so that I can quickly understand the package's purpose, installation, and usage like other SAGE packages.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] README has the exact structure defined in the template
- [x] Package tagline is concise and descriptive ("The Ground Truth")
- [x] All required sections (Overview, Installation, Quick Start, Core API, etc.) are present
- [x] Package is correctly categorized with appropriate badge

## Implementation Notes

- Need to create comprehensive documentation as it's currently minimal/missing
- Structure should emphasize foundational role in SAGE ecosystem
- Follow the standard template exactly

## âœ… Completed

This story has been completed. The README.md file has been restructured to follow the standardized template, with all required sections present and properly organized. The package is correctly categorized as "Production Ready" with an appropriate badge. Valuable technical content has been preserved and reorganized for better accessibility.
