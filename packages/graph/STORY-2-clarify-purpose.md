## Description

As a developer evaluating SAGE tools, I want to understand what Graph is and why it exists so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overview section clearly explains what Graph does (code knowledge representation)
- [ ] Value proposition is evident (ground truth, time-traveling, semantically rich)
- [ ] Connection to SAGE's "Ground Truth" concept is clear
- [ ] Relationship to code understanding and Gnosis principle is explained

## Implementation Notes

- Emphasize the "Ground Truth" concept and foundational nature
- Connect to graph thinking vs traditional text analysis
- Explain how this enables all other SAGE components
