## Description

As a developer wanting to try Graph, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Shows both Cypher and programmatic query examples
- [ ] Uses realistic code project as example

## Implementation Notes

- Create examples based on the existing README content
- Show both ingestion and querying capabilities
- Include realistic code project structure in example
