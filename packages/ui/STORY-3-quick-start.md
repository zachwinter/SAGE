# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to try UI package, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows basic UI component usage with primitives
- [ ] Demonstrates adapter selection (CLI vs Web)
- [ ] Shows a simple streaming component example
- [ ] Code is realistic and copy-pasteable

## Implementation Notes

- Create a simple example showing usage of basic primitives (Text, Row, Column)
- Include adapter selection example (CLI vs Web)
- Show a streaming component example if possible
- Focus on the most common and practical use case
