# Story 2: Clarify Package Purpose and Value

## Description

As a developer evaluating SAGE tools, I want to understand what UI package is and why it exists so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overview section clearly explains what UI package does (renderer-agnostic UI kit)
- [ ] Value proposition is evident (consistent rendering across CLI/Web, streaming-ready, themeable)
- [ ] Connection to SAGE's "Voice of the System" concept is clear
- [ ] Relationship to cross-platform UI development is explained

## Implementation Notes

- Emphasize the renderer-agnostic benefits and single codebase approach
- Connect to cross-platform UI development (CLI and Web)
- Explain how this enables consistent user experiences across environments
