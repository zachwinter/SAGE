# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to try Chronicle, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows appending a simple event (e.g., plan execution)
- [ ] Demonstrates querying event history
- [ ] Shows realistic event structure with proper types
- [ ] Core usage code is under 10 lines

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing examples from the current README
- Show both appendEvent and readChronicle in action
- Include a practical event structure that reflects real agent events
