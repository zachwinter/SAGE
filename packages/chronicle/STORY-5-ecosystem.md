# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how Chronicle relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/utils`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how `@sage/agents` and `@sage/aql` use Chronicle
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to agents' memory and state management is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how agents use Chronicle for state and memory
- Explain how AQL uses chronicle for historical analysis
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like integrity and auditability
