# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how tools relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/utils`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how `@sage/agents` and `@sage/mcp` use tools
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to agent operations and MCP integration is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how agents use tools for safe code operations
- Explain how MCP uses tools for LLM tool access
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like safety and validation
- Clarify the role of tools as the "hands" that execute agent intentions
