# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to try LLM package, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Quick Start shows basic LLM client setup with a common provider (OpenAI)
- [x] Demonstrates a simple chat completion
- [x] Shows tool integration if that's a key feature
- [x] Code is realistic and copy-pasteable

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing examples from the current README
- Show both setup and basic usage
- Include tool integration example but keep it simple
- Focus on the most common use case (OpenAI) for simplicity

## âœ… Completed

This story has been completed. The README.md file now includes clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start examples for both OpenAI and LM Studio providers. The examples demonstrate:

1. Basic LLM client setup with OpenAI
2. Simple chat completion
3. Tool integration example
4. Realistic and copy-pasteable code

The examples are comprehensive and cover the most common use cases for developers getting started with the @sage/llm package.
