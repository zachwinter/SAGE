# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to try LLM package, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows basic LLM client setup with a common provider (OpenAI)
- [ ] Demonstrates a simple chat completion
- [ ] Shows tool integration if that's a key feature
- [ ] Code is realistic and copy-pasteable

## Implementation Notes

- Use existing examples from the current README
- Show both setup and basic usage
- Include tool integration example but keep it simple
- Focus on the most common use case (OpenAI) for simplicity
