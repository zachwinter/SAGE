# Story 8: Configuration & Environment Management

## Goal

Implement comprehensive configuration system and environment handling for flexible deployment.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] Provider configuration management
- [ ] Environment variable integration
- [ ] Model allowlists per provider
- [x] Tool capability restrictions
- [ ] Secure configuration handling
- [ ] Runtime configuration updates

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration System

- Create configuration interface and types
- Implement configuration loading from files
- Add environment variable integration
- Create configuration validation

### Phase 2: Provider Configuration

- Implement provider-specific configuration
- Add model allowlists and restrictions
- Create tool capability controls
- Add provider initialization options

### Phase 3: Security & Secrets

- Implement secure secret handling
- Add configuration encryption options
- Create environment-specific configs
- Add secret redaction in logs

### Phase 4: Runtime Management

- Implement runtime configuration updates
- Add configuration hot-reloading
- Create configuration change notifications
- Add validation for runtime changes

### Phase 5: Integration & Testing

- Integrate configuration with all components
- Test environment variable overrides
- Validate model and tool restrictions
- Test secure configuration handling

### Phase 6: Documentation & Examples

- Create configuration documentation
- Add example configuration files
- Document environment variable usage
- Create best practices guide

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- Story 4: Provider Adapters
- Story 6: Advanced Error Handling & Safety
- Story 7: Telemetry & Observability

## Estimated Effort

**~~4-6 hours~~** - ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Provider config done, need env integration.

## Success Metrics ⚠️ PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

- [x] Configuration can be loaded from multiple sources (provider config)
- [ ] Environment variables are properly integrated (needs implementation)
- [ ] Model and tool restrictions work correctly (partial - tools done)
- [ ] Secrets are handled securely (needs implementation)
- [ ] Runtime configuration updates work reliably (needs implementation)
- [ ] System is ready for production deployment (depends on above)

## Current Status: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Provider Config Complete, Need Env Integration

Configuration infrastructure exists but needs environment integration:

**✅ Completed:**
- Provider configuration via ProviderConfig interface
- Tool capability restrictions via SecurityPolicyManager
- Runtime provider switching via setProvider()
- Comprehensive provider configuration options

**❌ Still Needed:**
- Environment variable auto-loading for API keys
- Configuration file support (.env, config.json)
- Model allowlists and capability detection per provider
- Secure secret handling and encryption
- Hot-reloading and configuration change notifications

**Implementation Notes:** Provider configuration is complete in BaseAdapter system, but production deployment needs environment integration.

**Maps to Story 10 (Production Readiness)** which handles environment configuration and deployment preparation.
