# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how LLM relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/mcp` and `@sage/utils`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how `@sage/agents` and CLI applications use LLM
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to agents' reasoning is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how agents use LLM for reasoning and mediation
- Explain the MCP integration benefits for tool usage
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like provider agnosticism and tool integration
