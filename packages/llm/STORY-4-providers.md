# Story 4: Provider Adapters

## Goal

Implement adapters for major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, LM Studio) with full streaming and tool calling support.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] OpenAI adapter with streaming and tool calling
- [x] Anthropic adapter with streaming and tool calling
- [x] LM Studio adapter (act-loop bridge compatibility)
- [x] Test/Fake provider for deterministic testing
- [x] Provider-specific error normalization
- [x] Consistent API across all adapters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Adapter Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create base adapter class/interface
- [x] Implement provider discovery and loading
- [x] Add adapter configuration system
- [x] Create adapter factory/registry

**Implementation Notes:** Complete base infrastructure in `src/adapters/base.ts` with `BaseAdapter`, `ProviderFactory`, and `AdapterRegistry`.

### Phase 2: OpenAI Adapter ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement streaming support using OpenAI SDK
- [x] Add tool calling integration
- [x] Handle OpenAI-specific error types
- [x] Implement model listing capabilities

**Implementation Notes:** Full implementation with OpenAI SDK integration in `src/adapters/openai.ts`.

### Phase 3: Anthropic Adapter ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement streaming support using Anthropic SDK
- [x] Add tool calling integration (Claude functions)
- [x] Handle Anthropic-specific error types
- [x] Implement model listing capabilities

**Implementation Notes:** Full implementation with Anthropic SDK integration in `src/adapters/anthropic.ts`.

### Phase 4: LM Studio Adapter ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement act-loop bridge as shown in NOTES.md
- [x] Add streaming support through LM Studio callbacks
- [x] Handle LM Studio-specific features
- [x] Implement model discovery

**Implementation Notes:** Complete implementation following the specification in NOTES.md in `src/adapters/lmstudio.ts`.

### Phase 5: MCP Adapter ✅ NEWLY ADDED

- [x] Implement MCP adapter that integrates with `@sage/mcp`'s `MCPClientManager`
- [x] Map the `@sage/llm` chat stream to the MCP protocol
- [x] Ensure tool calls are correctly handled through the MCP bridge

**Implementation Notes:** New adapter implementation in `src/adapters/mcp.ts` that bridges to the MCP protocol.

### Phase 6: Test/Fake Provider ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create deterministic test provider
- [x] Implement configurable responses
- [x] Add delay simulation for testing
- [x] Support both streaming and non-streaming modes

**Implementation Notes:** Comprehensive test provider implementation in `src/adapters/test.ts` with `TestProvider` and `TestProviderFactory` classes.

### Phase 7: Integration & Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Test all adapters with the core API (test provider)
- [x] Validate streaming behavior across providers
- [x] Test tool calling with each provider
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- Story 2: Streaming & Event System (completed)
- Story 3: Tool Integration & Validation (completed)

## Estimated Effort

**12-15 hours** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - All provider implementations finished.

## Success Metrics ✅ ACHIEVED

- [x] All major providers have working adapters
- [x] Streaming and tool calling work consistently across all providers
- [x] Error handling is normalized across providers
- [x] Test provider enables deterministic testing
- [x] Ready for agent integration in @sage/agents

## Current Status: ✅ ALL PROVIDERS COMPLETE

This story has been **fully completed** with all provider adapters implemented and tested:

**✅ Completed:**
- Base adapter system with sophisticated error handling
- Provider factory and registry system  
- Comprehensive OpenAI adapter with full SDK integration
- Comprehensive Anthropic adapter with full SDK integration
- Comprehensive LM Studio adapter with act-loop bridge
- New MCP adapter for Model Context Protocol integration
- Comprehensive test provider with all features
- Provider-agnostic API that works consistently across all providers

**Next Steps:**
1. Story 5 (Enhance Examples) - Add more comprehensive examples
2. Story 6 (Production Readiness & Polish) - Environment config, security, docs
