# Story 4: Provider Adapters

## Goal

Implement adapters for major LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, LM Studio) with full streaming and tool calling support.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [ ] OpenAI adapter with streaming and tool calling
- [ ] Anthropic adapter with streaming and tool calling
- [ ] LM Studio adapter (act-loop bridge compatibility)
- [x] Test/Fake provider for deterministic testing
- [x] Provider-specific error normalization
- [x] Consistent API across all adapters

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Adapter Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create base adapter class/interface
- [x] Implement provider discovery and loading
- [x] Add adapter configuration system
- [x] Create adapter factory/registry

**Implementation Notes:** Complete base infrastructure in `src/adapters/base.ts` with `BaseAdapter`, `ProviderFactory`, and `AdapterRegistry`.

### Phase 2: OpenAI Adapter ⚠️ PARTIAL - Skeleton Exists

- [ ] Implement streaming support using OpenAI SDK
- [ ] Add tool calling integration
- [ ] Handle OpenAI-specific error types
- [ ] Implement model listing capabilities

**Implementation Notes:** Basic structure exists in `src/adapters/openai.ts` but needs full implementation with OpenAI SDK integration.

### Phase 3: Anthropic Adapter ⚠️ PARTIAL - Skeleton Exists

- [ ] Implement streaming support using Anthropic SDK
- [ ] Add tool calling integration (Claude functions)
- [ ] Handle Anthropic-specific error types
- [ ] Implement model listing capabilities

**Implementation Notes:** Basic structure exists in `src/adapters/anthropic.ts` but needs full implementation with Anthropic SDK integration.

### Phase 4: LM Studio Adapter ⚠️ PARTIAL - Spec Ready

- [ ] Implement act-loop bridge as shown in NOTES.md
- [ ] Add streaming support through LM Studio callbacks
- [ ] Handle LM Studio-specific features
- [ ] Implement model discovery

**Implementation Notes:** Complete specification exists in NOTES.md with detailed implementation plan. Skeleton in `src/adapters/lmstudio.ts` needs completion.

### Phase 5: Test/Fake Provider ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create deterministic test provider
- [x] Implement configurable responses
- [x] Add delay simulation for testing
- [x] Support both streaming and non-streaming modes

**Implementation Notes:** Comprehensive test provider implementation in `src/adapters/test.ts` with `TestProvider` and `TestProviderFactory` classes.

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing ⚠️ PARTIAL

- [x] Test all adapters with the core API (test provider)
- [ ] Validate streaming behavior across providers (needs real providers)
- [ ] Test tool calling with each provider (needs real providers)
- [x] Ensure consistent error handling

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- Story 2: Streaming & Event System (completed)
- Story 3: Tool Integration & Validation (completed)

## Estimated Effort

**~~12-15 hours~~** - ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Infrastructure complete, need real provider implementations.

## Success Metrics ⚠️ PARTIALLY ACHIEVED

- [ ] All major providers have working adapters (infrastructure ✅, implementations needed)
- [x] Streaming and tool calling work consistently (via test provider)
- [x] Error handling is normalized across providers
- [x] Test provider enables deterministic testing
- [ ] Ready for caching implementation in Story 5

## Current Status: ⚠️ INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE, IMPLEMENTATIONS NEEDED

This story has **excellent infrastructure** but needs the actual provider implementations completed:

**✅ Completed:**
- Base adapter system with sophisticated error handling
- Provider factory and registry system  
- Comprehensive test provider with all features
- Provider-agnostic API that works consistently

**❌ Still Needed:**
- OpenAI adapter implementation (skeleton exists)
- Anthropic adapter implementation (skeleton exists)  
- LM Studio adapter implementation (spec ready in NOTES.md)

**This maps directly to new Story 9 (Provider Completion)** which focuses on completing these three critical provider implementations.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Prioritize Story 9** - Complete the three production provider adapters
2. Story 5 (Caching) is already implemented and can proceed
3. Story 6 (Error Handling) is largely complete via BaseAdapter system
