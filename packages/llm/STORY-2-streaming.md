# Story 2: Streaming & Event System

## Goal

Implement full streaming support with backpressure handling and proper event emission across all provider types.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] Real-time token emission with backpressure handling
- [x] Proper AsyncIterable support with correct iteration semantics
- [x] Event normalization across different provider implementations
- [x] Round start/end events for multi-turn conversations (specifically for LM Studio)
- [x] Error propagation that maintains stream integrity
- [x] Support for both streaming and non-streaming providers
- [x] Backpressure-friendly stream implementation using async queues

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Enhanced Stream Event Types ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Extend `StreamEvent` type definitions to include round events
- [x] Add proper TypeScript discriminants for all event types  
- [x] Document event sequences and lifecycle

**Implementation Notes:** All event types implemented in `src/types.ts` with proper discriminants and type guards.

### Phase 2: Stream Utilities ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create utility functions for stream manipulation
- [x] Implement backpressure handling mechanisms
- [x] Add stream merging and transformation utilities
- [x] Create error boundary wrappers for streams

**Implementation Notes:** Complete implementation in `src/stream-utils.ts` with AsyncQueue and withErrorBoundary.

### Phase 3: Provider Stream Wrapping ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Enhance the `createChatStream` function to handle complex event sequences
- [x] Implement proper async queue for backpressure management
- [x] Add stream timeout and cancellation support
- [x] Ensure proper resource cleanup

**Implementation Notes:** Full implementation in `src/api.ts` with timeout handling, cancellation, and proper resource cleanup.

### Phase 4: Event Normalization ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create adapter layer for normalizing provider-specific events
- [x] Implement event transformation pipelines
- [x] Add validation for event sequences
- [x] Handle edge cases in event emission

**Implementation Notes:** Event normalization implemented in `src/event-normalization.ts` with stream enhancement in `enhanceStreamWithRounds`.

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create comprehensive tests for streaming behavior
- [x] Test backpressure scenarios with slow consumers
- [x] Validate error handling in streams
- [x] Test both streaming and non-streaming provider adapters

**Implementation Notes:** Extensive test suite in `__tests__/` covering streaming, caching integration, and tool integration scenarios.

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)

## Estimated Effort

**~~6-8 hours~~** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Core streaming infrastructure fully implemented.

## Success Metrics ✅ ALL ACHIEVED

- [x] Can handle real-time token streaming with proper backpressure
- [x] Works consistently across different provider types
- [x] Properly handles errors without breaking stream consumers
- [x] Passes all streaming-related tests in the test suite
- [x] Ready for tool integration in Story 3

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This story is **fully implemented**. The streaming infrastructure is comprehensive and production-ready, including:

- Full `AsyncIterable` support with backpressure management
- Round start/end events for LM Studio integration
- Error boundaries that maintain stream integrity  
- Support for both streaming and non-streaming providers
- Comprehensive test coverage

**Next:** Story 3 (Tool Integration) can proceed, or focus on Story 9 (Provider Completion) for production readiness.
