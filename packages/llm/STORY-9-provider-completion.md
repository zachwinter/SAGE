# Story 9: Provider Adapter Completion

## Goal

Complete the implementation of production provider adapters (OpenAI, Anthropic, LM Studio, and MCP) to make @sage/llm fully functional with a variety of local and remote LLM services.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] **OpenAI adapter** with streaming, tool calling, and error handling
- [x] **Anthropic adapter** with streaming, tool calling, and error handling  
- [x] **LM Studio adapter** implementing the act-loop bridge from NOTES.md
- [x] **MCP adapter** that integrates with `@sage/mcp`'s `MCPClientManager`.
- [x] All adapters support the unified StreamEvent interface
- [x] Provider-specific error normalization and retry logic
- [x] Model discovery and availability checking
- [x] Rate limiting and authentication handling
- [x] Tool schema conversion for each provider's format

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: OpenAI Adapter Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement streaming chat completion with proper event mapping
- [x] Add tool calling support using OpenAI's functions API
- [x] Handle OpenAI-specific errors (rate limits, auth, model availability)
- [x] Implement token usage tracking and reporting
- [x] Add model listing and capability detection

### Phase 2: Anthropic Adapter Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement streaming with Anthropic's Messages API
- [x] Add tool calling support using Anthropic's tools format
- [x] Handle Anthropic-specific errors and rate limiting
- [x] Implement proper message role mapping
- [x] Add Claude model listing and feature detection

### Phase 3: LM Studio Adapter Integration ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Integrate the act-loop bridge specification from NOTES.md
- [x] Implement proper tool call guarding and approval flow
- [x] Handle round start/end events from LM Studio callbacks
- [x] Add proper streaming with fragment assembly
- [x] Implement chat session management and reuse

### Phase 4: MCP Adapter Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement an `MCPProvider` that wraps `@sage/mcp`'s `MCPClientManager`.
- [x] Map the `@sage/llm` chat stream to the MCP protocol.
- [x] Ensure tool calls are correctly handled through the MCP bridge.
- [x] Add dependency on `@sage/mcp`.

### Phase 5: Provider Registration & Discovery ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement provider auto-registration system
- [x] Add runtime provider switching capabilities
- [x] Create provider capability introspection
- [x] Add configuration validation per provider
- [x] Implement provider health checks

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create comprehensive provider integration tests
- [x] Test error scenarios and recovery for each provider
- [x] Validate tool calling across all providers
- [x] Test streaming performance and backpressure handling
- [x] Add provider-specific configuration examples

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- BaseAdapter class and error handling infrastructure (completed)
- Stream utilities and event normalization (completed)
- `@sage/mcp` for the `MCPClientManager`.

## Estimated Effort

**12-16 hours** - Significant work to implement three production providers with full feature parity.

## Success Metrics

- [x] All four providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, LM Studio, MCP) are functional
- [x] Can switch between providers at runtime using setProvider()
- [x] Tool calling works identically across all providers
- [x] Streaming events are normalized to the same interface
- [x] Error handling is robust and provider-aware
- [x] All existing tests pass with real provider implementations
- [x] Ready for agent integration in @sage/agents

## Implementation Notes

### OpenAI Integration ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
import OpenAI from 'openai';
import { BaseAdapter } from './base.js';
import type { ChatOptions, StreamEvent } from '../types.js';

export class OpenAIAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  private client: OpenAI;
  
  constructor(config: { apiKey: string; baseURL?: string }) {
    super('openai', config);
    this.client = new OpenAI(config);
  }
  
  async *chat(opts: ChatOptions): AsyncIterable<StreamEvent> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

### Anthropic Integration ✅ COMPLETED
```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';
import { BaseAdapter } from './base.js';

export class AnthropicAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  private client: Anthropic;
  
  constructor(config: { apiKey: string }) {
    super('anthropic', config);
    this.client = new Anthropic(config);
  }
}
```

### LM Studio Integration ✅ COMPLETED
Implementation follows the detailed specification from NOTES.md with proper tool call handling and round management.

### MCP Integration ✅ COMPLETED
The `MCPAdapter` acts as a bridge to the `@sage/mcp` package, which handles the complexities of the MCP protocol.

```typescript
import { MCPClientManager } from '@sage/mcp';
import { BaseAdapter } from './base.js';

export class MCPAdapter extends BaseAdapter {
  private mcpManager: MCPClientManager;

  constructor(mcpManager: MCPClientManager) {
    super('mcp', {});
    this.mcpManager = mcpManager;
  }
}
```

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

All provider adapters have been successfully implemented and tested. The @sage/llm package now supports:

1. **OpenAI** - Full SDK integration with streaming and tool calling
2. **Anthropic** - Full SDK integration with streaming and tool calling
3. **LM Studio** - Act-loop bridge implementation for local models
4. **MCP** - Integration with Model Context Protocol for enterprise-grade LLM management
5. **Test** - Deterministic testing provider

The package is now ready for production use with any of these providers.
