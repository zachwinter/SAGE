# Story 5: Caching & Performance

## Goal

Implement prompt-level caching with multiple modes to improve performance and reduce API costs.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] Cache key: `(model, messages, tools, temperature, max_tokens)` canonically hashed
- [x] Cache modes: read-through, record-only, bypass
- [x] Full-turn caching (not token-level) to avoid replay artifacts
- [x] Optional prompt hashing for privacy
- [x] Cache hit/miss tracking and metrics

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cache Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create cache interface and in-memory implementation
- [x] Implement canonical key generation
- [x] Add cache configuration options
- [x] Create cache mode enum and handling

**Implementation Notes:** Complete cache infrastructure in `src/cache/` with `MemoryCache`, `CacheManager`, and configuration types.

### Phase 2: Canonical Key Generation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement deterministic JSON canonicalization
- [x] Create hashing utilities using @sage/utils
- [x] Handle cache key composition from ChatOptions
- [x] Add prompt hashing option for privacy

**Implementation Notes:** Sophisticated key generation in `src/cache/key-generator.ts` with canonical hashing and privacy options.

### Phase 3: Cache Modes Implementation ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Implement read-through cache mode
- [x] Implement record-only cache mode
- [x] Implement bypass cache mode
- [x] Add mode selection API

**Implementation Notes:** All cache modes implemented in `CacheManager` with proper mode handling and configuration.

### Phase 4: Integration with Core API ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Integrate caching with createChatStream
- [x] Add cache configuration to ChatOptions
- [x] Implement cache hit/miss tracking
- [x] Add cache metrics reporting

**Implementation Notes:** Full integration in `src/api.ts` with cache lookup, storage, and metrics tracking via `withCaching` function.

### Phase 5: Testing & Optimization ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create comprehensive cache tests
- [x] Test cache key generation edge cases
- [x] Validate cache modes behave correctly
- [x] Optimize performance for high-throughput scenarios

**Implementation Notes:** Extensive test coverage in `src/cache/__tests__/` covering all cache functionality and integration scenarios.

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- Story 4: Provider Adapters (infrastructure completed)

## Estimated Effort

**~~6-8 hours~~** - ✅ **COMPLETED** - Caching system fully implemented.

## Success Metrics ✅ ALL ACHIEVED

- [x] Cache key generation is deterministic and correct
- [x] All cache modes work as expected
- [x] Performance improves with caching enabled
- [x] Privacy features work correctly with prompt hashing
- [x] Ready for advanced error handling in Story 6

## Current Status: ✅ COMPLETED

This story is **fully implemented**. The caching system is sophisticated and production-ready, including:

**✅ Complete Caching System:**
- Multi-level cache architecture with memory backend
- Canonical key generation with deterministic hashing
- Three cache modes (read-through, record-only, bypass)
- Optional prompt hashing for privacy-sensitive environments
- Comprehensive metrics and monitoring
- Full integration with the streaming API

**Key Features Implemented:**
- `MemoryCache` with TTL and LRU eviction
- `CacheManager` with mode handling and lookup optimization
- `KeyGenerator` with canonical JSON hashing using @sage/utils
- Cache integration in `createChatStream` with transparent hit/miss handling
- Extensive test coverage including edge cases and performance scenarios

**Cache Modes Working:**
- **Read-through**: Check cache first, execute and store on miss
- **Record-only**: Always execute but store results for future use
- **Bypass**: Skip cache entirely for live results

**Next:** All infrastructure stories are complete. Focus on Story 9 (Provider Completion) for production readiness.
