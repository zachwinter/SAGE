# Story 6: Advanced Error Handling & Safety

## Goal

Implement robust error handling, safety features, and reliability mechanisms for production use.

## Acceptance Criteria

From CLAUDE.md requirements:

- [x] Configurable timeouts with defaults (30s)
- [x] Exponential backoff retry with jitter
- [x] Provider-specific error normalization
- [ ] Rate limiting and token budget guards
- [ ] Secret redaction in telemetry
- [x] Error boundaries and fallback behavior

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Timeout & Cancellation

- Enhance timeout handling in ChatOptions
- Implement request cancellation with AbortController
- Add timeout configuration per request
- Create timeout error types

### Phase 2: Retry & Backoff System

- Implement exponential backoff with jitter
- Create retry policies and configuration
- Add retry counting and limiting
- Handle transient vs permanent errors

### Phase 3: Error Normalization

- Create error normalization layer
- Implement provider-specific error mapping
- Add error categorization (transient, permanent, rate_limit, etc.)
- Create unified error types

### Phase 4: Rate Limiting & Budgets

- Implement rate limiting guards
- Add token budget tracking
- Create quota management system
- Add circuit breaker pattern for reliability

### Phase 5: Security & Privacy

- Implement secret redaction in logs/telemetry
- Add input sanitization
- Create privacy-preserving error messages
- Implement secure configuration handling

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing

- Integrate error handling with core API
- Test error scenarios with all providers
- Validate retry and backoff behavior
- Test rate limiting and budget enforcement

## Dependencies

- Story 1: Core API & Provider Interface (completed)
- Story 4: Provider Adapters
- Story 5: Caching & Performance

## Estimated Effort

**~~8-10 hours~~** - ⚠️ **MOSTLY COMPLETE** - Core error handling implemented, some features remain.

## Success Metrics ⚠️ MOSTLY ACHIEVED

- [x] Timeouts are configurable and work correctly
- [x] Retry system handles transient errors appropriately
- [x] Errors are normalized across providers
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents abuse (needs implementation)
- [ ] Secrets are properly redacted (needs implementation)
- [x] System is production-ready with proper error boundaries

## Current Status: ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLETE

The error handling infrastructure is **substantially implemented** via the BaseAdapter system:

**✅ Completed in BaseAdapter:**
- Configurable timeouts with AbortController
- Sophisticated retry logic with exponential backoff + jitter
- Provider-specific error normalization (ProviderError, RateLimitError, AuthenticationError, etc.)
- Error boundaries via stream utilities (withErrorBoundary)
- Comprehensive error type hierarchy

**❌ Still Needed:**
- Rate limiting and token budget enforcement
- Secret redaction in telemetry (maps to Story 7)
- Additional safety guardrails

**Implementation Notes:** Most error handling is implemented in `src/adapters/base.ts` with the `BaseAdapter.withRetry()` method and error type hierarchy.
