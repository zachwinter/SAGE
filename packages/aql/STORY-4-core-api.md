# Story 4: Document Core API

## Description

As a developer integrating AQL into my project, I want clear documentation of the main classes and methods so that I can effectively use the package in my code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core API section documents the main `AQL` class
- [ ] Key methods (`parseQuery`, `executeQuery`, `run`) are explained with examples
- [ ] Configuration methods (`setDebug`, `setTimeout`, `setRetries`) are documented
- [ ] Types and interfaces are referenced appropriately

## Implementation Notes

- Extract API information from `src/index.ts` and execution engine
- Show real method signatures and usage patterns
- Keep examples minimal but illustrative
