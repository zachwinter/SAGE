# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to try AQL, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows a simple AQL query that demonstrates core capabilities
- [ ] Example combines graph query with agent action if possible
- [ ] Code is realistic and shows actual workflow pattern
- [ ] Experimental status is clearly indicated

## Implementation Notes

- Use one of the existing examples from `examples/basic/` as a starting point
- Show how to instantiate and run a basic query
- Include both programmatic and CLI usage if applicable
