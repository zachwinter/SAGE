# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how AQL relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/graph` and `@sage/agents`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how `@sage/agents` uses AQL
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Integration roadmap is referenced for future context

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how AQL integrates with the Delegator
- Explain the planned transition from TypeScript plans to AQL queries
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like determinism and auditability
