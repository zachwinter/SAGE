As a developer evaluating SAGE tools, I want to understand what AQL is and why it exists so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overview section clearly explains what AQL does (declarative orchestration)
- [ ] Value proposition is evident (strong typing, deterministic planning, framework-agnostic)
- [ ] Connection to SAGE's agent orchestration is clear
- [ ] Experimental nature is prominently indicated

## Implementation Notes

- Emphasize the "Declarative Orchestrator" concept
- Connect to agent workflows as the primary use case
- Be honest about prototype status while showing vision
