# Story 4: Document Core API

## Description

As a developer integrating test-utils into my package tests, I want clear documentation of the main classes and methods so that I can effectively use the package in my tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core API section documents main functions (`createTempWorkspace`, `vitestConfigs`, adapters, matchers)
- [ ] Key interfaces and entry points are explained
- [ ] Testing utilities and their use cases are documented
- [ ] Configuration options and patterns are covered

## Implementation Notes

- Extract API information from the existing README
- Show real function signatures and usage patterns
- Document the different entry points (`fs`, `adapters`, `agents`, etc.)
- Explain the testing utilities and when to use each one
