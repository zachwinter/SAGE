# Story 5: Map Ecosystem Relationships

## Description

As a developer understanding the SAGE architecture, I want to see how test-utils relates to other packages so that I can understand its role in the larger system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dependencies section lists and explains `@sage/utils` and `vitest`
- [ ] Dependents section shows how all SAGE packages use test-utils
- [ ] Relationships are described in terms of data flow and responsibilities
- [ ] Connection to package development and testing is clear

## Implementation Notes

- Be specific about how all SAGE packages depend on test-utils
- Explain the role of package developers as primary users
- Connect to broader SAGE principles like reliability and determinism
- Clarify how this enables consistent testing across the ecosystem
