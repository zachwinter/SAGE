# Story 1: Standardize README Structure

## Description

As a developer contributing to the SAGE ecosystem, I want the `@sage/test-utils` README to follow the standardized template so that I can quickly understand the package's purpose, installation, and usage like other SAGE packages.

## Implementation Notes
