# Story 2: Clarify Package Purpose and Value

## Description

As a developer evaluating SAGE tools, I want to understand what test-utils package is and why it exists so that I can determine if it's relevant to my needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Overview section clearly explains what test-utils package does (comprehensive testing infrastructure)
- [ ] Value proposition is evident (deterministic testing, isolated workspaces, standardized configs)
- [ ] Connection to SAGE's "Controlled Environment" concept is clear
- [ ] Relationship to testing philosophy and reliability is explained

## Implementation Notes

- Emphasize the deterministic testing and isolation benefits
- Connect to SAGE's integrity principles and reliability requirements
- Explain how this enables fast, reproducible tests across all packages
