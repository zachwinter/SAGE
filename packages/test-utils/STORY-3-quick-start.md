# Story 3: Provide Working Quick Start Example

## Description

As a developer wanting to use test-utils for package development, I want a clear, copy-pasteable Quick Start example so that I can quickly get up and running with the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Quick Start shows setting up a test with temp workspace
- [ ] Demonstrates key testing utilities (adapters, matchers)
- [ ] Shows standardized vitest config usage
- [ ] Code is copy-pasteable for package developers

## Implementation Notes

- Create a practical example showing temp workspace creation and usage
- Include examples of key utilities like adapters and custom matchers
- Show how to use the standardized vitest configuration
- Focus on the most common use cases for package developers
