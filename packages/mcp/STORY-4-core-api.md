# Story 4: Document Core API

## Description

As a developer integrating MCP into my project, I want clear documentation of the main classes and methods so that I can effectively use the package in my code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core API section documents main classes (`MCPClientManager`, transports, etc.)
- [ ] Key interfaces and functions are explained
- [ ] Tool registration and invocation patterns are documented
- [ ] Server and client perspectives are both covered

## Implementation Notes

- Extract API information from the existing README
- Show real class signatures and usage patterns
- Document both server and client APIs
- Explain transport implementations and how to use them
