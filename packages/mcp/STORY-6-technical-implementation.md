# Story 6: Document Technical Implementation and Protocol Details

## Description

As a contributor to the SAGE project or advanced user, I want to understand the technical implementation details and protocol specifics so that I can effectively use or contribute to the package.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Development Status clearly indicates current state and testing infrastructure
- [ ] Protocol details and multi-transport support are documented
- [ ] Testing infrastructure and migration plans are explained
- [ ] Architecture decisions and implementation strategy are covered

## Implementation Notes

- Document the multi-transport support (stdio, HTTP, etc.)
- Explain the server lifecycle management capabilities
- Reference the comprehensive test suite and migration to test-utils
- Cover architecture decisions that distinguish MCP from other protocol implementations
