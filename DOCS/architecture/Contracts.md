# 📋 SAGE Contracts & Standards

**SAGE** embraces a **contract-first philosophy** — every agent, package, and interface is governed by explicit contracts that define behavior, responsibilities, and guarantees.

## 🎯 Philosophy

Contracts are not just documentation; they are **living agreements** that:
- **Define clear boundaries** between system components
- **Establish behavioral guarantees** that other parts of the system can rely on
- **Enable safe composition** of complex workflows
- **Provide regression testing targets** for system reliability
- **Document intended usage patterns** for developers and AI agents

## 🏛️ System-Wide Contracts

### 📊 Core Graph Contract
The foundational contract that defines how all code knowledge is represented:
- **[Graph Schema](../packages/graph/README.md#schema)** — Node types, relationships, properties
- **[Query Interface](../packages/aql/README.md)** — How to retrieve and manipulate graph data
- **[Commit Addressability](../packages/graph/README.md#versioning)** — Immutable snapshots and versioning

### 📚 Chronicle Contract  
The append-only event system that maintains system history:
- **[Event Schema](../packages/chronicle/README.md#events)** — Standard event types and payloads
- **[Persistence Guarantees](../packages/chronicle/README.md#persistence)** — Durability and ordering promises
- **[Query Capabilities](../packages/chronicle/README.md#queries)** — Historical analysis and replay

### 🧠 LLM Interface Contract
The unified interface to language model providers:
- **[Provider Abstraction](../packages/llm/README.md#providers)** — Common interface across OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **[Tool Integration](../packages/llm/README.md#tools)** — Standardized function calling
- **[Streaming Protocol](../packages/llm/README.md#streaming)** — Real-time response handling

## 🎭 Archetype Contracts

Each SAGE archetype implements a specific behavioral contract:

### 🧙 [Sage Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#sage-contract)
*The Mind of the System*
- **Planning Capabilities:** Must generate executable AQL workflows
- **Reasoning Interface:** Question decomposition and strategic thinking
- **Orchestration Role:** Coordinate other archetypes for complex tasks

### 🛡️ [Guardian Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#guardian-contract)  
*The Soul of the Code*
- **Quality Gates:** Must evaluate code changes against project standards
- **Consistency Enforcement:** Detect and flag deviations from patterns
- **Protection Duties:** Prevent harmful modifications to critical code

### 📚 [Librarian Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#librarian-contract)
*The Custodian of Data*
- **Search Interface:** Must provide semantic code search capabilities  
- **Indexing Responsibilities:** Maintain up-to-date graph representations
- **Retrieval Guarantees:** Return relevant context within token limits

### ⚔️ [Warden Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#warden-contract)
*The Shield of the Realm*
- **Access Control:** Must enforce permission-based operation restrictions
- **Security Validation:** Scan for potential security vulnerabilities
- **Audit Trail:** Log all security-relevant actions

### 👥 [Delegator Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#delegator-contract)
*The Executor* 
- **Task Execution:** Must reliably execute AQL workflows
- **Error Handling:** Provide meaningful failure reports and recovery options
- **Resource Management:** Respect system limits and timeouts

### 📝 [Archivist Contract](../packages/agents/README.md#archivist-contract)
*The Memory*
- **Event Capture:** Must record all significant system interactions
- **History Preservation:** Maintain immutable event sequences
- **Continuity Assurance:** Detect and alert on inconsistencies

## 📦 Package Contracts

Each package maintains its own detailed contract specification:

| Package | Contract Location | Key Responsibilities |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **[agents](../packages/agents/README.md#contract)** | `packages/agents/CONTRACT.md` | Archetype implementations, reasoning logic |
| **[graph](../packages/graph/README.md#contract)** | `packages/graph/CONTRACT.md` | Code analysis, relationship extraction, querying |
| **[chronicle](../packages/chronicle/README.md#contract)** | `packages/chronicle/CONTRACT.md` | Event logging, history management, persistence |
| **[llm](../packages/llm/README.md#contract)** | `packages/llm/CONTRACT.md` | Multi-provider abstraction, tool integration |
| **[aql](../packages/aql/README.md#contract)** | `packages/aql/CONTRACT.md` | Query language parsing, execution, optimization |
| **[mcp](../packages/mcp/README.md#contract)** | `packages/mcp/CONTRACT.md` | Model Context Protocol implementation |
| **[tools](../packages/tools/README.md#contract)** | `packages/tools/CONTRACT.md` | Sandboxed operations, safety guarantees |
| **[ui](../packages/ui/README.md#contract)** | `packages/ui/CONTRACT.md` | Renderer-agnostic UI kit, platform-neutral primitives |
| **[test-utils](../packages/test-utils/README.md#contract)** | `packages/test-utils/CONTRACT.md` | Testing infrastructure, mocks, harnesses |
| **[utils](../packages/utils/README.md#contract)** | `packages/utils/CONTRACT.md` | Core utilities, type definitions, helpers |

## 🧪 Contract Testing

SAGE employs comprehensive contract testing to ensure all agreements are honored:

### Automated Verification
```typescript
// Example: Testing the Sage archetype contract
describe('Sage Contract', () => {
  it('must generate valid AQL workflows', async () => {
    const sage = new SageAgent(mockConfig);
    const plan = await sage.createPlan('Refactor authentication system');
    
    expect(plan).toBeValidAQL();
    expect(plan.steps).toHaveMinimumLength(1);
    expect(plan.dependencies).toBeResolvable();
  });
});
```

### Integration Testing
- **Cross-package compatibility** — Ensure packages work together as specified
- **Archetype collaboration** — Verify agents can successfully coordinate
- **End-to-end workflows** — Test complete user scenarios

### Contract Evolution
- **Versioned contracts** — Changes are tracked and backward-compatible when possible
- **Migration guides** — Clear instructions for updating to new contract versions
- **Deprecation policies** — Graceful phase-out of obsolete contract features

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Adding New Contracts
1. **Design Phase:** Define the contract's scope, guarantees, and interface
2. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive contract specification
3. **Implementation:** Build the functionality to satisfy the contract
4. **Testing:** Write contract tests to verify compliance
5. **Integration:** Ensure compatibility with existing system contracts

### Modifying Existing Contracts
1. **Impact Analysis:** Identify all dependent components
2. **Backward Compatibility:** Maintain existing guarantees when possible
3. **Migration Strategy:** Plan transition for breaking changes
4. **Testing Updates:** Update contract tests to reflect changes
5. **Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation

## 🎯 Best Practices

### Writing Good Contracts
- **Be Specific:** Define exact inputs, outputs, and behaviors
- **Include Examples:** Show concrete usage patterns
- **Specify Error Conditions:** Document failure modes and error handling
- **Define Performance Characteristics:** Include timing and resource constraints
- **Plan for Evolution:** Design contracts that can grow gracefully

### Testing Contracts
- **Test the Interface, Not Implementation:** Focus on external behavior
- **Include Edge Cases:** Test boundary conditions and error scenarios  
- **Use Property-Based Testing:** Verify contracts hold for all valid inputs
- **Mock Dependencies:** Isolate contract testing from external dependencies
- **Automate Verification:** Run contract tests in CI/CD pipeline

*The strength of SAGE lies not in any single component, but in the reliability of the agreements between them. By making these contracts explicit and testable, we create a system that can evolve while maintaining its essential guarantees.*
