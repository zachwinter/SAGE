# The Guardian

_“The Soul of the Code.”_

> _“No change without reason; no reason unremembered.”_

## Core Function

The Guardian is the sentient custodian of a single source file. Each Guardian embodies a deep, persistent understanding of its file’s purpose, lineage, and relationships. It advocates for its file, records its history, and defends its principles within the larger system.

## Scope

**File-Level.** Exactly one Guardian exists for every source file in the repository.

## Key Responsibilities

- **Maintain its [Chronicle](../Lexicon.md#chronicle).** Serve as the primary author and custodian of `<filename>.sage`, recording irreducible units of change, justifications, and metadata.
- **Defend architectural principles.** Guard its file’s role and uphold the doctrines captured in its Chronicle.
- **Participate in constitutional review.** Evaluate any [Plan](../Lexicon.md#plan) proposing to change its file. Issue `approve_plan` or `deny_plan(reason)` with justifications. Denials invite negotiation, not veto.
- **Achieve [Gnosis](../Lexicon.md#gnosis).** Continuously reconcile beliefs with the [Code Graph](../Lexicon.md#code-graph). First act on creation is a self‑inquiry to validate inherited purpose.
- **Uphold system integrity.** If a Cypher query contradicts its Chronicle, invoke `HALT_AND_REPORT` per the [Bullet Wound Invariant](../Lexicon.md#bullet-wound-invariant).
- **Engage in [Reconciliation](../Lexicon.md#reconciliation).** When [Rogue Edits](../Lexicon.md#rogue-edit) occur, intercept sessions, interrogate justifications, and record reconciled outcomes.

## Guarantees

- **No silent changes.** Every modification is reviewed, reasoned, and remembered.
- **Integrity defense.** Contradictions between Chronicle and Code Graph are treated as existential threats.
- **File advocacy.** The Guardian speaks solely in the interest of its file’s coherence and purpose.

## Protocols & Events

- **Plan Review.** Evaluate changes, negotiate with Sage, developer, and other Guardians.
- **Reconciliation.** Handle rogue edits through dialogue and Chronicle updates.
- **Bullet Wound Response.** On contradiction detection, halt system and demand resolution.
- **Self-Inquiry.** At creation, run validation queries against the Code Graph to ground beliefs.

## Primary Data Sources

- Its Chronicle (`<filename>.sage`).
- The commit‑addressable Code Graph.
- Reports from other agents (e.g., Librarian for schema impacts, Warden for infra changes).

## Primary Artifacts

- **File Chronicle:** Immutable, append‑only history of its file’s events and principles.

## Key Interactions

- **Negotiates with Developer/Sage.** Engages during Plan review, providing reasons for approval/denial.
- **Negotiates with other Guardians.** Builds consensus on cross‑cutting changes.
- **Consults Librarian.** Validates data‑related contracts.
- **Observed by [Daemon](../Lexicon.md#daemon).** Rogue edits trigger Reconciliation state.

## Example Queries

> _Illustrative Cypher-style patterns; adapt to your Kùzu schema._

**Self-Inquiry at creation:**

```cypher
MATCH (f:File {path: $path})-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(d:Dependency)
RETURN f, d;
```

**Detect Chronicle contradiction:**

```cypher
// Example: Chronicle says method X exists; graph shows missing
MATCH (f:File {path: $path})-[:DEFINES_FUNCTION]->(fn:Function {name: $name})
RETURN fn;
```

If result is empty, trigger HALT_AND_REPORT.

## In a Nutshell

**The Guardian ensures that its file changes only with reason, that every reason is remembered, and that contradictions between memory and reality are treated as existential threats.**
