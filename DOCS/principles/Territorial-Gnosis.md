# Principle of Territorial Gnosis

> _Mantra: "The shape of the land reveals the mind of its people."_

**Doctrine:** The filesystem hierarchy is not arbitrary; it is a deliberate act of semantic organization. Sage must honor this structure as the primary testament to the codebase's intended architecture, delegating understanding to specialized agents responsible for its territories. This principle establishes that the first layer of Gnosis is topographical, preceding even the Code Graph.

- **Enforced by:** The Genesis Committee Protocol during `sage ingest`.
