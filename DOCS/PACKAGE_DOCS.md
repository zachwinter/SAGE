# üì¶ Package Documentation Update Instructions

This document provides focused instructions for updating individual package READMEs to conform to the new SAGE documentation standards.

## üéØ Task Overview

**Objective:** Refactor each package's README.md to follow the standardized template in `DOCS/PACKAGE_README_TEMPLATE.md`

**Success Criteria:**
- Concise, scannable README with clear Quick Start section
- Proper ecosystem context (dependencies/dependents)
- Copy-pasteable code examples that actually work
- Consistent structure across all packages

## üìã Standard Template Structure

Every package README must follow this exact structure:

```markdown
# @sage/[package-name]

> [One-line tagline describing the package's purpose]

## Overview
[2-3 sentences explaining what this package does and why it exists]

## Installation
```bash
pnpm add @sage/[package-name]
```

## Quick Start
```typescript
import { [MainExport] } from '@sage/[package-name]';

// Minimal, copy-pasteable example demonstrating primary use case
const example = new [MainExport]();
await example.[primaryMethod]();
```

## Core API
### [PrimaryClass]
[Brief description with key method signatures]

## üîç Package Analysis Checklist

Before updating each package, analyze:

### 1. **Core Purpose**
- [ ] What is the single most important thing this package does?

- [ ] What's the most common usage pattern?
- [ ] What imports would a new user need?

### 3. **Dependencies & Dependents**
- [ ] Which @sage packages does this depend on? (check package.json)
- [ ] Which @sage packages depend on this? (search codebase)
- [ ] Why are these relationships important?

### 4. **Development Status**
- [ ] Is this package stable/production-ready?
- [ ] Is it under active development?
- [ ] Are there known limitations or planned changes?

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Process

For each package:

### Step 1: Analyze Current README
1. Read the existing README completely
2. Identify the core purpose and main exports
3. Note any good examples or explanations to preserve
4. Check package.json for actual dependencies

### Step 2: Create Quick Start Example
1. Find the simplest possible usage example
2. Ensure it's copy-pasteable and actually works
3. Use realistic imports and setup
4. Show the most common use case, not edge cases

### Step 3: Map Ecosystem Relationships
1. Check package.json dependencies for @sage/* packages
2. Search codebase for imports of this package
3. Explain WHY these relationships exist, not just WHAT they are

### Step 4: Write New README
1. Follow the template exactly
2. Use the existing good content but reorganize it
3. Be ruthlessly concise - cut anything non-essential
4. Focus on "what" and "how", less on "why" (that's in the manifesto)

### Step 5: Validate
1. Check that all links work
2. Verify the Quick Start example is accurate
3. Ensure consistent tone and formatting
4. Test that the copy-paste example actually works

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **TMI (Too Much Information):** Keep READMEs focused on getting started, not comprehensive API docs
2. **Broken Examples:** Always verify code examples actually work
3. **Generic Descriptions:** Be specific about this package's unique role
4. **Missing Context:** Explain WHY this package exists in SAGE's ecosystem
5. **Inconsistent Formatting:** Follow the template structure exactly

## üéØ Success Metrics

A good package README should:
- [ ] Take <2 minutes to read and understand
- [ ] Have a working Quick Start example someone can copy-paste
- [ ] Clearly explain the package's unique role in SAGE
- [ ] Link properly to dependencies and dependents
- [ ] Follow the exact template structure

## üìù Notes for Implementation

- **Work on one package at a time** to maintain focus
- **Test examples in a real environment** before finalizing
- **Preserve any unique, valuable content** from existing READMEs
- **Be consistent with terminology** - use the Lexicon
- **Link liberally** to other docs and packages

*This systematic approach ensures every package has professional, consistent documentation that helps developers understand and use SAGE effectively.*
