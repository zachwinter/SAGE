# SAGE Principles & Protocols

This section unifies the constitutional doctrines of SAGE (Principles) with their enforcement mechanisms (Protocols & Invariants). Principles are enduring laws; protocols are the operational rules by which agents enforce them.

## Principles

SAGE's foundational beliefs that guide its behavior and decision-making.

- **[Principle of Territorial Gnosis](../principles/Territorial-Gnosis.md)** â€” The filesystem hierarchy is a deliberate act of semantic organization.
- **[Principle of Noticing](../principles/Noticing.md)** â€” The system must filter reality through a lens of purpose.
- **[Principle of Remembering](../principles/Remembering.md)** â€” Every noticed event must be immortalized.
- **[Principle of Gnosis](../principles/Gnosis.md)** â€” Belief must always be anchored to verifiable knowledge.
- **[Principle of Integrity](../principles/Integrity.md)** â€” The systemâ€™s ground truth is sacred.
- **[Principle of Secrets](../principles/Secrets.md)** â€” Sensitive values are for machines, not for minds.

## Protocols & Invariants

The operational rules by which agents enforce the Principles.

- **[Bullet Wound Invariant](../protocols/Bullet-Wound-Invariant.md)** â€” Contradictions between Chronicle and Code Graph halt execution.
- **[Transaction Boundary](../protocols/Transaction-Boundary.md)** â€” Plans execute atomically; changes are committed only if all validators pass.
- **[Unsafe Protocol](../protocols/Unsafe-Protocol.md)** â€” Allows execution of denied Plans with explicit user override.
- **[Reconciliation](../protocols/Reconciliation.md)** â€” External file modifications trigger dialogue with the responsible Guardian.
- **[Committee Formation](../protocols/Committee-Formation.md)** â€” Manages large-scale Plans affecting many Guardians.
- **[Post-Mortem Protocol](../protocols/Post-Mortem-Protocol.md)** â€” The system learns from operational failures.

## In a Nutshell

**Principles declare what must always be true; protocols enforce them. Together they ensure SAGE remains vigilant, self-correcting, and aligned with reality.**
